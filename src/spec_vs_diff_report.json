  "summary": "REQ-15 appears implemented by removing the avatar/portrait element from both mobile and desktop ArtistRow layouts while retaining rank, name, Reach Score, RankShiftIndicator, Hype badge, and the existing top-10 US flag indicator. REQ-16 is implemented at least for ArtistRow via crisper rounding (rounded-sm). REQ-17 is partially implemented in the page by rendering two right-corner accent images, but the required static image assets themselves are not added in the diff summary.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-17",
      "requirement": "Add subtle music-themed and business-themed decorative right-corner accents using generated static image assets served from frontend static assets.",
      "reason": "The UI references the two required ornament PNGs under /assets/generated, but the diff shows no added files; therefore the required static image assets are not present/implemented in this change set (at least per the diff summary).",

      "id": "REQ-16",
      "requirement": "Sharpen leaderboard row/card boxes by reducing corner rounding consistently across mobile/desktop rows/cards and any leaderboard container cards that use the same styling.",
      "reason": "Only ArtistRow.tsx explicitly shows reduced rounding (rounded-sm). The diff summary does not provide evidence that any leaderboard container cards (or other shared card components) were updated to match, so consistent application across all relevant containers cannot be verified from the provided diff summary.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/leaderboard/ArtistRow.tsx (uses rounded-sm)",
        "No modified Leaderboard/LeaderboardHeader files shown in diff summary content"

      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly lists non-goals around changing leaderboard logic/fields; while sample data changes are not backend logic, they were not requested and may be considered scope creep.",
