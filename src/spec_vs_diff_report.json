  "summary": "REQ-13 appears implemented by conditionally rendering a US flag icon for ranks <= 10 in both mobile and desktop layouts of ArtistRow. REQ-14 is only partially addressed because the code references a static asset path, but the required generated flag image file is not shown as added in the diff summary. Additionally, the diff includes references to unrequested theme/background and sample data changes in metadata/summary files.",

      "requirement": "Use a generated static, non-photo American flag asset placed under frontend/public/assets/generated and referenced by a stable local path.",
      "reason": "ArtistRow references the asset path \"/assets/generated/us-flag-icon.dim_64x48.png\", but the diff summary shows no new files added (and specifically no asset added under frontend/public/assets/generated), so the required image is not evidenced as present.",
