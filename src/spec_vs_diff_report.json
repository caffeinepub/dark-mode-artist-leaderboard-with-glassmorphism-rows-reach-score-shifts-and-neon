  "summary": "The diff updates global theme/CSS variables in `frontend/src/index.css` to a light blue palette and applies it consistently to `body` and the `.mandala-bg` container used by `ArtistLeaderboardPage`, with some text color adjustments for readability. No clear missing requirements are evident from the provided diff summary, but there is at least one unrequested UI/content change (footer attribution/link styling/content).",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added/modified footer attribution content and external link/UTM parameters (and heart glyph styling) on the Artist Leaderboard page, which was not requested as part of the background/readability change.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest is limited to changing the page background to light blue and ensuring readability/contrast; it explicitly lists non-goals including no new features/behavior changes. Footer attribution/link changes are unrelated to the stated requirements.",
