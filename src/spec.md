# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refine the Artist Leaderboard UI by removing avatar icons, making row/card edges crisper, and adding subtle music + business right-corner decorative accents that match the existing palette.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the avatar/profile picture element from each Artist Leaderboard row in both mobile and desktop layouts, ensuring no leftover spacing and preserving existing rank/name/Reach Score/trend/Hype badge/top-10 US flag behavior.
- Reduce border-radius (corner rounding) for leaderboard rows/cards (and any shared leaderboard container card styling) to create sharper, crisper edges while keeping the current light-blue theme and readable hover/focus states.
- Add two subtle right-corner decorative accents (music-themed and business-themed) using new static image assets, positioned so they do not overlap content and scale appropriately on mobile and desktop.

**User-visible outcome:** Leaderboard rows no longer show avatar icons, cards look sharper, and the leaderboard UI includes subtle music and business corner accents without impacting readability or existing indicators.
