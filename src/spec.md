# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the first two sample artist names shown on the Artist Leaderboard.

**Planned changes:**
- Update `frontend/src/data/artistLeaderboardSample.ts` so the entry with `rank: 1` has `name: "Atif Aslam"`.
- Update `frontend/src/data/artistLeaderboardSample.ts` so the entry with `rank: 2` has `name: "Arijit Singh"`.

**User-visible outcome:** The Artist Leaderboard page displays “Atif Aslam” and “Arijit Singh” as the first two ranked artists, with all other leaderboard fields and entries unchanged.
