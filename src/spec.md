# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Artist Leaderboard page background to a light blue while keeping the page readable and visually consistent.

**Planned changes:**
- Change the Artist Leaderboard page background from the current dark/coffee-toned background to a light blue color using the existing theme/CSS variable approach so both the `mandala-bg` container and `body` background are consistent.
- Adjust foreground styles as needed to maintain readability and contrast (text, glassmorphism cards/rows, and overlay layers) on the new light blue background.
- Ensure the mandala pattern and paper texture overlays remain subtle and do not reduce readability on the light blue background.

**User-visible outcome:** The Artist Leaderboard page displays with a light blue background, with clear readable text and distinct leaderboard cards/rows while preserving subtle mandala/paper texture overlays.
